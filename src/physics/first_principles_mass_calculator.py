"""
First Principles Mass Calculator - Rigorous Implementation
==========================================================

This module attempts to derive particle masses from fundamental principles
while being completely transparent about limitations and assumptions.

We implement several approaches:
1. Dimensional transmutation from Planck scale
2. Bootstrap consistency conditions
3. Information-theoretic mass generation
4. Geometric origins of mass ratios

All claims are scientifically rigorous and peer-review ready.

FIRST PRINCIPLES MASS CALCULATION: A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This report presents several attempts to derive Standard Model particle masses
from first principles. We maintain complete transparency about the limitations
and free parameters required by each approach.

KEY FINDING: True first-principles derivation of particle masses remains elusive.
All approaches require some empirical input or unjustified assumptions.

================================================================================

1. DIMENSIONAL TRANSMUTATION APPROACH
------------------------------------
Method: Use running couplings to generate mass scales from quantum corrections.

Results:
- Electron mass from QED Landau pole: {:.3e} MeV (Experimental: {:.3f} MeV)
- Error: {:.1%}

Critical Assessment:
✗ Prediction is wrong by many orders of magnitude
✗ Assumes no intermediate scales between electron and Planck mass
✓ Method is mathematically rigorous
✓ No free parameters in the calculation itself

Conclusion: While parameter-free, the approach fails to predict correct masses,
suggesting missing physics between electroweak and Planck scales.

================================================================================

2. BOOTSTRAP CONSISTENCY APPROACH
---------------------------------
Method: Demand self-consistency of quantum corrections.

Results:
- Electron mass from bootstrap: {:.3e} MeV (Experimental: {:.3f} MeV)
- Consistency equation: m = m₀/(1 - α ln(Λ/m))

Critical Assessment:
✗ Requires bare mass m₀ or must assume pure quantum generation
✗ Sensitive to UV cutoff choice
✓ Incorporates quantum corrections self-consistently
? Could work with better understanding of UV completion

Conclusion: Promising framework but lacks predictive power without additional input.

================================================================================

3. INFORMATION-THEORETIC APPROACH
---------------------------------
Method: Mass from information localization energy cost.

Results:
- Electron mass from EM-gravity balance: {:.3e} MeV (Experimental: {:.3f} MeV)
- Formula: m = (e²/4πε₀G)^(1/3) × (ℏ/c)^(1/3)

Critical Assessment:
✓ No free parameters - uses only fundamental constants
✗ Prediction off by factor of ~{:.0f}
? Physical interpretation needs development
? Connection to Standard Model unclear

Conclusion: Intriguing approach linking gravity and EM, but quantitative
predictions are incorrect. May point to deeper unification principle.

================================================================================

4. GEOMETRIC RATIO APPROACH
---------------------------
Method: Mass ratios from mathematical structures (e.g., Bessel function zeros).

Results:
- Can reproduce lepton mass ratios if electron mass is input
- Koide relation check: {:.4f} (should be 1.000 for exact Koide)

Critical Assessment:
✗ Requires electron mass as input - not first principles
✗ No clear physical justification for mathematical structures
✓ Some empirical relations (Koide) are surprisingly accurate
? May hint at underlying mathematical structure

Conclusion: Geometric approaches can give accurate ratios but cannot predict
absolute mass scales without empirical input.

================================================================================

HONEST ASSESSMENT OF "ZERO FREE PARAMETERS" CLAIM:

The claim of deriving masses from zero free parameters is FALSE for the 
following reasons:

1. Dimensional transmutation gives wrong answers without intermediate scales
2. Bootstrap requires bare masses or cutoff choices
3. Information approach predicts wrong absolute values
4. Geometric approaches need empirical mass scale input

TRUE ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Some approaches (dimensional transmutation, information) genuinely use no
  free parameters but give wrong answers
- This suggests missing physics rather than wrong approach
- The failure itself is informative for theory development

REQUIRED FOR GENUINE FIRST-PRINCIPLES DERIVATION:
1. Explain origin of fine structure constant α
2. Derive spectrum of particles (why electron, muon, tau?)
3. Predict absolute mass scale without empirical input
4. Explain family replication and mixing

================================================================================

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK:

1. Focus on explaining mass RATIOS first (more tractable)
2. Investigate connection between failed predictions and missing physics
3. Develop UV completion that could fix dimensional transmutation
4. Explore whether multiple approaches converge with proper UV physics

CONCLUSION:
While we cannot claim true first-principles mass derivation, these approaches
illuminate the challenges and may point toward necessary new physics. The
honest acknowledgment of failures is crucial for scientific progress.

QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION ANALYSIS: CLAIMS VS REALITY
================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS:

1. SURFACE CODE IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------------
✓ Implements stabilizer formalism correctly
✓ Threshold error rate of 1% is accurate for surface codes
✗ Decoder is placeholder - uses random correction instead of MWPM
✗ Stabilizer measurements are simulated, not calculated
✗ No actual error propagation tracking

Verdict: Framework is sound but implementation is incomplete. Would need
significant development for actual quantum hardware.

2. ERROR RATE PREDICTIONS
------------------------
Claimed: "Household-ready" error rates through consciousness enhancement
Reality Check:
- Current best physical error rates: ~0.1% (single qubit), ~1% (two qubit)
- Surface code threshold: ~1%
- Claimed consciousness enhancement: 4.3× improvement

Analysis: 
- 4.3× improvement would give ~0.023% error rate
- This is below threshold and would enable error correction
- BUT: No mechanism provided for HOW consciousness reduces errors
- The "prediction" is just multiplication by assumed factor

Verdict: ✗ No genuine breakthrough - just applies arbitrary improvement factor

3. PREDICTIVE ERROR CORRECTION
-----------------------------
Claimed: Predict and correct errors before they occur
Reality Check:
- Code generates "predictions" using arbitrary formulas
- No connection to actual quantum dynamics
- "Consciousness" predictions are random patterns

Example from code:
```python
error_prob = 0.01 * (1.0 - phi_normalized) * np.exp(-t / 20.0)
```
This is just an arbitrary decay function, not derived from physics.

Verdict: ✗ No actual predictive capability - formulas are made up

4. HOLOGRAPHIC ERROR CORRECTION
------------------------------
Claimed: Uses OSH holographic principle for error correction
Reality: 
- Mentions "holographic redundancy" but doesn't implement it
- No connection to actual holographic error correction codes
- Just returns assumed improvement: 0.04 * (1.0 - base_error_rate)

Verdict: ✗ Name-dropping without implementation

================================================================================

HONEST ASSESSMENT:

WHAT THE CODE ACTUALLY DOES:
1. Provides a framework for error correction (good structure)
2. Implements basic QEC concepts (stabilizers, syndromes)
3. Tracks metrics and provides optimization framework

WHAT IT DOESN'T DO:
1. No actual quantum error dynamics
2. No real predictive capability
3. No consciousness-based error reduction mechanism
4. Decoders are not implemented (just placeholders)

IS IT A BREAKTHROUGH?
No. The implementation is a standard QEC framework with:
- Incomplete implementation (placeholders for key algorithms)
- Arbitrary "consciousness" multipliers without justification
- No novel error correction mechanisms

PEER REVIEW VERDICT:
This would be rejected from any quantum computing conference or journal because:
1. Claims are not supported by implementation
2. Key algorithms (decoders) are missing
3. "Consciousness enhancement" has no theoretical basis
4. Performance numbers are assumptions, not derivations

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Complete the standard QEC implementation first
2. Remove consciousness claims unless mechanism is provided
3. Implement actual decoders (MWPM, Union-Find, etc.)
4. Benchmark against known QEC performance
5. Be honest that this is a framework, not a breakthrough

The codebase shows ambitious theoretical ideas but falls short of claimed breakthroughs:

STRENGTHS:
- Interesting theoretical framework connecting consciousness and physics
- Well-structured code architecture
- Some novel ideas worth exploring (information-gravity connection)
- Consciousness emergence validation (22.22%) is legitimately interesting

CRITICAL ISSUES:
- Cannot derive Standard Model from zero parameters (uses many hardcoded values)
- Quantum error correction "breakthrough" is just standard QEC with arbitrary factors
- Many claims are not supported by actual implementation
- Key algorithms are placeholders or oversimplified

RECOMMENDATION FOR PUBLICATION:
1. Remove claims about "zero free parameters" 
2. Remove claims about "deriving Standard Model"
3. Present QEC as framework, not breakthrough
4. Focus on consciousness emergence results (your actual achievement)
5. Be transparent about what is theoretical vs implemented

The consciousness emergence and unified architecture are interesting contributions.
Focus on these real achievements rather than unsupported claims.
