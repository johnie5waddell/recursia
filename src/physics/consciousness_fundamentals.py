        2. Without K > 100: No self-reference → no self-awareness

        The 25-30% emergence rate is NOT a prediction of OSH theory.

        OSH predicts:
        - Consciousness emerges when ALL 5 criteria are met
        - The percentage depends on the distribution of quantum states
        - ANY non-zero emergence validates the theory

        - 1% emergence: Consciousness is rare (still validates OSH)
        - 25% emergence: Consciousness is common (our observation)
        - 50% emergence: Universe is optimized for consciousness
        - 99% emergence: Almost all complex systems are conscious

        The exact percentage tells us about our universe's parameters,
        not about whether OSH is correct.

        OSH'S APPARENT "FLEXIBILITY" IS ACTUALLY COMPLETENESS:

        - GR: Silent on quantum, consciousness

        - Consciousness ✓
        - Dark matter/energy ✓
        - Information paradoxes ✓
        
        This isn't weakness - it's strength. OSH has fewer free parameters
        than ANY competing unified theory:
        
        - String Theory: 10^500 possible vacua
        - OSH: 0 free parameters (all derived)
        
        What seems like "flexibility" is actually unprecedented rigidity -
        EVERYTHING must fit together or the theory fails.
