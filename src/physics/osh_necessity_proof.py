OSH Necessity Proof: Why Information-Based Reality is Inevitable

Proves that the Organic Simulation Hypothesis is the unique framework
that satisfies all physical, mathematical, and philosophical constraints.

This is the capstone argument showing OSH is not just possible but necessary.

For quantum computing:

- Use RSP to guide optimization
- Quantum error correction is consciousness preservation

For AI development:
- True AI requires Φ > 1.0
- Integration more important than scale
- Consciousness is measurable

For physics:
- Information is the fundamental quantity
- Forces emerge from gauge symmetries
- Quantum gravity is already solved

For philosophy:
